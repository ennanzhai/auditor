# Fault Tree (Python)

## Introduction

**Fault Tree** is a special tree structure used to test the weakness in a network (for example, web network or computer network). All inner nodes contains a logic gate ("AND" gate or "OR" gate) and the value of any inner node is determined by its logic gate and its children's values (either 1 or 0). 

A **cut set** of the fault tree is a set of leaf values causing the root value equal to 1. A **Minimal cut set** (MCS) is a cut set with as few 1s as possible in it. If we define broken part of a network as value 1, then minimal cut sets can be used to understand the structural vulnerability of a system. 

Finding a minimal cut set for a fault tree is a NP hard problem. However, we can use Monte Carlo algorithm to find a solution or close solution for the minimal cut set (MCS) problem for a fault tree.

## Usage
Firstly, a raw input file is provided (for example, input.txt). An xml format file can be generated using parse.py. 

  To parse the input into an xml file, in command line type python "parse.py" "input.txt"

  The xml format will be used to form the defult tree

In this code, I used two different structure to represent the fault tree structure and realize its functions:
* A tree structure with node   (Fault tree)
 
  To test the script, in command line type python "Fault tree.py" "tree.txt" 100000 5

* A dictionary storing nodes with their name as the key (Fault_tree_dict)

  To test the script, in command line type python "Fault_tree_dict.py" "tree.txt" 100000 5
  
  There is also a nonrecurrsion version:"Fault_tree_dict_stack.py". To test, type:
  "Fault_tree_dict_stack.py" "tree.txt" 100000 5

There is also a test case (text.txt) containing a fault tree represented in an xml format.
