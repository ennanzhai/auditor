   vs our template flowset. Patch from stephen AT sfnelson.org.
   https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1760

20091001
 - (djm) Lots of manpage tweaks from Tamas TEVESZ, ice AT extreme.hu

   as the input and output interface of all flows generated. Patch from
   kempf AT rpi.edu
 - (djm) One more manpage tweak from Tamas TEVESZ.

   Suggestion from Tamas TEVESZ.

 - (djm) Implement a very simple freelist allocator for flows and expiry
   events

 - (djm) Move max_flows into struct FLOWTRACK

20070726
 - (djm) Add flow_get/flow_put and expiry_get/expiry_put functions to 
   allocate and deallocate flows and expiry events, instead of calling
   malloc/free directly. Right now these functions just call malloc/free
   anyway, but they will soon be used to implemented pooled flow/expiry
   allocations.

20070725
 - (djm) KNF
 - (djm) Correctly exit from mainloop on signal - patch from Florian Weimer

   bug noticed and patch tested by andreas.brillisauer AT hetzner.de

20040930
 - (djm) Increase caplen a little for IPv6
 - (djm) Remove unused debugging code from NetFlow v.9 support

   them for now), print addresses:port tuples unambiguously and apply correct 
   timeout for ICMPv6 flows

 - (djm) NetFlow v.9 support
 
20040913

   additional export protocols
 - (djm) Collect netflow export target information together in a struct, in 
   preparation for more export protocols and support for multiple export targets
 - (djm) Optimise the datalink_check function, by caching the last datalink type
   used.

20040909

 - (djm) Portability fixes for Linux, add closefrom()

   from IPv4 parsing code
 - (djm) Be more careful about putting flows into canonical format
 - (djm) Prepare for IPv6 packet to flow conversion routine

20040430
 - (djm) Release version 0.9

20040417
 - (djm) Fix invalid packet bug

20040417
 - (djm) Eliminate periodic expiry scans, wait in poll() only until the next 
   scheduled expiry event
 - (djm) Separate timeout for ICMP traffic, generic timeout is too long

20040416
 - (djm) A bunch of changes necessary to support building on Solaris 9 (though
   the resultant binary doesn't seem to work properly):
        - Use getaddrinfo instead of inet_aton to parse host/port for export
        - Use setreuid if setresuid isn't around (ditto for gid)
        - Add replacement daemon() function from OpenBSD
        - Provide our own logit() function, because Solaris syslog() doesn't 
          support LOG_PERROR
        - A heap of configure and common.h additions and fixes
 - (djm) Fix busted preprocessor

20031111
 - (djm) Remove -Werror from CFLAGS, it causes problems in released software

20031109
 - (djm) Give compile-time choice over flow and expiry event tree type
   default is splay tree for flows and red-black tree for expiry events
   (limited benchmarking indicates that this is the fastest)
 - (djm) Lock the BPF device to prevent changes should the unpriv child
   be compromised (only OpenBSD supports this ioctl for now)

20031001

 - (djm) Add "strip" target to Makefile
 - (djm) Add "help" keyword to recognised softflowctl responses
 - (djm) Fix fragment handling bug: we would try to look into fragmented
   payload on later fragments. This could cause random tcp/udp  port numbers
   to be recorded.
 - (djm) Fix malicious fragment handling bug: deliberately tiny fragments 
   (e.g. http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/ptacek98insertion.html) would be ignored
   and would not create flow entries.
 - (djm) Count fragments that we have seen
 - (djm) Release version 0.8.1

 - (djm) Add basic perl netflow collector

20021110

 - (djm) Add some examples to the manpage

20021030
 - (djm) New user-friendly time specification code from OpenSSH/Kevin Steves
 - (djm) Always use local sys-tree.h (for older OpenBSD's)

20021029
 - (djm) Multiple fixes and improvements from Octavian Cerna <tavy@ylabs.com>
    - softflowd.c (connsock): Fix arguments to `connect': addr is a pointer, 
	not a structure.
      (flow_update_expiry): Properly compute the flow lifetime.
      (send_netflow_v1): Count the leftover packet.
	Send flow_start, flow_finish and uptime_ms as Cisco equipment 
	does: milliseconds since system boot.
      (timeval_sub_ms): New function.
      (main): Changed POLL_WAIT to be (EXPIRY_WAIT/2) as stated in the 
	comment above `poll': twice per recheck.
	`poll' takes the last argument in milliseconds.
	Initialize system_boot_time as the time at the start of capture
	(fixme: how does this affect reading from capture files?)

20021024
 - (djm) Release softflowd-0.7.1
