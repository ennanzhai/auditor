Version 0.5
-----------
- Changed project name from STING to MAPPING
- Changed sample salt generation from random prime to random bits
- Changed salt to 64 bit for C version of sefasi_sample, currently
  down-casted to 32bit though, since we use murmur 32 bit

Version 0.4
-----------
- The init_enc command now aborts if the input data is not a proper
  set and contains duplicate elements
- In each data_enc permutation duplicate elements are removed (a warning is
  printed if this happens). This avoids a duplicate element probing attack.
  Thanks to Ennan Zhai for pointing me to this problem.
- Changed the size check for data_enc. Don't trust the .size file, but
  count elements in file (and estimate min unsampled when sampling)

Version 0.3
-----------
- All the test scripts have an optional parameter now that if set to any
  value will cause the use of the faster C tools; there are no separate
  fast-version scripts anymore
- Changed -n command line switch of sefasi_set_intersect and
  sefasi_capture_data to -N to make it consistent with -N switch of
  sefasi_main.py (excuse the backwards incompatibility)
- Improved README
- Added LC_ALL=C to sort calls in sefasi_main.py and test scripts to enforce 
  consistent sort order with different locale settings
- Added test script for n-party intersection (without probing detection)
- Added test script for sorting datasets

Version 0.2
-----------
- Added missing test sub directory

Version 0.1
-----------
- Initial version
