REQUIREMENTS
------------

SeFaSI requires python. We tested SeFaSI with python 2.6 and 2.7. It may work
with older python versions. SeFaSI requires the following non-standard
python modules:

blist (version 1.3.4 or higher)
pycrypto (version 2.6 or higher)
murmur (version 0.1.3 or higher)

The setup script should automatically install these modules. However, in
case this fails a manual installation is necessary. The modules can be
downloaded here:

blist: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/blist/
pycrypto: https://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/
murmur: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Murmur/

SeFaSI also also needs the tools wc and sort. Both must be in the path.

The python setup script requires that either the setuptools or the distutils
module is installed. 

NOTE: automatic installation of the Python dependencies only works with setuptools.
If there is a warning "Unknown distribution option: 'install_requires'"
you need to install the dependencies manually (or install setuptools from
https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

For a number of the tools we also implemented faster versions in C, but some
of the tools including the main script exist only as python implementation.
Installing the C versions of the tools requires the GNU autotools and
the following libraries:

libcrypto (openssl crypto library version 0.9.8 or higher)


INSTALLATION
------------

Download the latest version from http://caia.swin.edu.au/mapping/tools .

Unpack the tar archive, e.g. for version 0.1:
$ tar -xvzf sefasi-0.1.tar.gz

Install SeFaSI, e.g. for version 0.1:
$ cd sefasi-0.1
$ sefasi_install.sh <prefix>

The script will install the SeFaSI python scripts and C tools. The default
prefix (if prefix is not specified) is /usr/local. The python scripts
and C tools can be installed separately as described below.

Installation of python scripts (fully functional SeFaSI):

$ python setup.py install

By default the scripts in the src sub directory are installed in /usr/local/bin. The path can
be changed by specifying a prefix. For example, the following command
would install the scripts in /home/user/bin.

$ python setup.py install --prefix=/home/user/ 

For more information on setup options see "python setup.py --help" or
http://docs.python.org/2/install/.

The files in the test sub directory are not installed.

Installation of the C tools:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

By default the C tools are installed in /usr/local/bin. The path can
be changed by specifying a prefix for the configure command as follows:

$ ./configure --prefix=/home/user/

NOTE: if your system has old versions of the autotools and fails during configure 
or make the following commands will (hopefully) setup the make scripts correctly:

$ aclocal
$ autoheader
$ automake
$ autoconf


RUNNING
-------

The test sub directory of the distribution contains test scripts that
illustrate how SeFaSI can be used with two parties. They are described
in more detail in README.txt.

Also, README.txt contains some examples showing how to use SeFaSI.
